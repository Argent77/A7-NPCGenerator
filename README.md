## Overview

Have you ever regretted that the game only allowed you to create an initial party consisting of the protagonist and (with some effort) a small number of additional characters? Not anymore!

This mod allows you to install any number of pregenerated or exported characters as regular NPCs. They can be met at predetermined locations where you have the chance to invite them into your party or have them tag along without occupying party slots at any time in the game. Kicked out NPCs can be instructed to wait or return to the original meeting place.

**NOTE:** The mod isn't registered in the WeiDU.log and can therefore be called at any time and as often as you like to install or remove NPCs to or from the game.

The mod supports the following games and game variants:
- Original BG2
- Tutu/EasyTutu
- BGT (Baldur's Gate Trilogy)
- BG:EE
- SoD (Siege of Dragonspear)
- BG2:EE
- EET (Enhanced Edition Trilogy)
- IWD:EE

## Components

### Add custom NPCs to the game (for BG2, Tutu, BGT, BG:EE, SoD, BG2:EE, EET and IWD:EE)

With this component it is possible to install any number of individual characters or all available characters at once.

This component offers two installation modes: *manual* and *automated*.

Manual installation provides a menu-driven character selection. Automated installation is controlled by a settings file and requires no manual input. It is therefore the best choice for mod managers or scripted mod installations.

### Enable/Disable alignment checks for custom NPCs (not available for IWD:EE)

By default installed NPCs won't always join or follow the party right away. If their goals don't align with the party's they might ask for a fee or outright refuse to join.

With this component it is possible to toggle this check on or off. When disabled then every installed NPC will automatically join or follow your party when asked.

### Remove custom NPCs from the game

This component allows you to remove installed characters from the game. You can choose whether to uninstall selected characters individually or all installed characters at once.
