# NPC Generator
*Install your own pregenerated or exported characters as regular NPCs.*

## Overview

Have you ever regretted that the game only allowed you to create the protagonist or (with some effort) up to five additional characters? Not anymore!

This mod allows you to install any number of pregenerated or exported characters as regular NPCs. They can be met at predetermined locations where you have the chance to invite them into your party or have them tag along without occupying party slots at any time in the game. Kicked out NPCs can be instructed to wait or return to the original meeting place.

The mod supports the following games and game variants:
- Original BG2
- Tutu/EasyTutu
- BGT (Baldur's Gate Trilogy)
- BG:EE
- SoD (Siege of Dragonspear)
- BG2:EE
- EET (Enhanced Edition Trilogy)
- IWD:EE

The mod is currently available in English and German.

## Components

### Add custom NPCs to the game (for BG2, Tutu, BGT, BG:EE, SoD, BG2:EE, EET and IWD:EE)

With this component it is possible to install any number of individual characters or all available characters at once.

This component offers two installation modes: *manual* and *automated*.

Manual installation provides a menu-driven character selection. Automated installation is controlled by a settings file and requires no manual input. It is therefore the best choice for mod managers or scripted mod installations.

**NOTE:**
This component won't be registered in the WeiDU.log and can therefore be called anytime and as many times you want to install characters as NPCs. To uninstall NPCs use the second component of the mod ("Remove custom NPCs from the game").

### Enable/Disable alignment checks for custom NPCs (not available for IWD:EE)

By default installed NPCs won't always join or follow the party right away. If their goals don't align with yours they might ask for a fee or outright refuse to join.

With this component it is possible to toggle this check on or off. When disabled then every installed NPC will automatically join or follow your party when asked.

### Remove custom NPCs from the game

This component allows you to remove installed characters from the game. You can choose whether to uninstall selected characters individually or all installed characters at once.
